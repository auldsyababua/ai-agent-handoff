## Development History

### 2025-06-10 14:30 - Commit: 7e2a8f9
- **What**: Fixed rate limiting bug in authentication middleware
- **Why**: Users were getting locked out after 3 failed attempts instead of 5
- **Issues**: None, all tests passing
- **Next**: Continue working on team invitation flow

### 2025-06-10 11:15 - Commit: 3d9c2b1
- **What**: Added email validation to team invitation process
- **Why**: Need to verify email format before sending invitations
- **Issues**: Email service integration not yet complete
- **Next**: Implement email sending for invitations

### 2025-06-10 09:45 - Commit: f8a7c6e
- **What**: Started implementing team invitation backend
- **Why**: Feature required for milestone 2
- **Issues**: None yet
- **Next**: Add email validation

### 2025-06-09 16:20 - Commit: 2b5d7e9
- **What**: Refactored AI prioritization algorithm
- **Why**: Previous implementation had O(nÂ²) complexity, causing timeouts with large task lists
- **Issues**: Scores now more efficient but less consistent with previous version
- **Next**: Fine-tune the algorithm to match previous behavior while maintaining performance

### 2025-06-09 14:05 - Commit: 9c3d8f2
- **What**: Added caching layer to AI prioritization
- **Why**: Reduce OpenAI API costs and improve response time
- **Issues**: Cache invalidation needs more testing
- **Next**: Refactor algorithm for better efficiency

### 2025-06-09 10:30 - Commit: 4e7a1b5
- **What**: Implemented notification preferences UI
- **Why**: Allow users to control which notifications they receive
- **Issues**: Mobile layout needs adjustment
- **Next**: Connect to backend notification settings

### 2025-06-08 15:45 - Commit: 8b2e6d3
- **What**: Added backend support for notification preferences
- **Why**: Users need control over notification frequency
- **Issues**: None, all tests passing
- **Next**: Implement frontend UI for preferences

### 2025-06-08 11:20 - Commit: 5a4f9c2
- **What**: Fixed task sorting bug in workspace view
- **Why**: Tasks weren't respecting manual sort order
- **Issues**: None, verified with multiple test cases
- **Next**: Start on notification preferences

### 2025-06-08 09:00 - Commit: 1c7d3e6
- **What**: Added task drag-and-drop reordering
- **Why**: Users need to manually override AI prioritization
- **Issues**: Performance slows with >100 tasks
- **Next**: Fix sorting bug in workspace view

### 2025-06-07 16:30 - Commit: 6b8a2d5
- **What**: Implemented AI priority scoring endpoint
- **Why**: Core feature for automatic task prioritization
- **Issues**: Occasional timeouts with large task lists
- **Next**: Add UI support for reordering

## Architecture Decisions

### 2025-06-05 - AI Provider Selection
- **Context**: Need to choose an AI provider for the prioritization engine
- **Decision**: Use OpenAI API with gpt-3.5-turbo model
- **Alternatives Considered**: Google Vertex AI, self-hosted model
- **Consequences**: Better accuracy but higher operational costs

### 2025-06-01 - Authentication System
- **Context**: Need secure user authentication
- **Decision**: Use JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Alternatives Considered**: Session-based auth, OAuth only
- **Consequences**: Better scalability but more complex implementation

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 2025-06-06 - Data Loss Prevention - Commit: 3e5f7d9
- **Issue**: Task updates were sometimes lost during concurrent edits
- **Root Cause**: Missing optimistic locking mechanism
- **Fix**: Added version field to tasks and optimistic locking in update endpoint
- **Verification**: Added load test that simulates concurrent edits

## Deployment History

### 2025-06-07 - Staging - Commit: 6b8a2d5
- **Changes**: Deployed AI prioritization feature
- **Issues**: Initial high latency, fixed by adjusting cache settings
- **Verification**: Manual testing and automated smoke tests passed

### 2025-06-01 - Production - Commit: 9d2e4b7
- **Changes**: Initial production deployment
- **Issues**: Database connection pool too small, adjusted
- **Verification**: All monitoring metrics normal after adjustment

## Recovery Events

### 2025-06-03 - API Rate Limit Exceeded
- **Problem**: Hit OpenAI API rate limits during testing
- **Impact**: AI prioritization unavailable for 30 minutes
- **Recovery Action**: Implemented token bucket rate limiting and better caching
- **Prevention**: Added monitoring alerts for API usage approaching limits
